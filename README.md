Web application using the C# MVC ASP.Net Core.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created this Car Shop application by using:
- Visual Studio 2019 on Windows
- ASP.NET Core platform
- C# programming language
- Model–view–controller (MVC)
- SQL

You can select the cars by category: electrical or fuel, you can add cars to the shopping cart, and process your purchase by inputting your personal information and submit the purchase.
